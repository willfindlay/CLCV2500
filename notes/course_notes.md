# Intro / Organization

## Sample Question

"What did Agamemnon's murder mean to 5th century Athenians"

- Agamemnon -> Mycenae
    - was killed
- many components to this question
    - contents of myth
    - history
    - culture
    - interpretation

## What Do Lecture Numbers Mean?

- week.lecture
- e.g. 3.2
    - week 3, lecture 2

## Grading and Assignments

- online quizzes
    - open for whole day
    - maximum 8 MC each
- midterm (Monday after the break?)
    - in class (but on cuLearn, during class time)
    - part MC
    - part written response (we will know the question a week beforehand)
- either final exam like midterm or final assignment where we re-write a story in a given style and justify it

# What is Myth?

- story passed on
- folklore
    - what does folk mean here?
    - implicit opposition to writing
    - high culture vs low culture (folk is low) -> implies a register
- old wive's tales
    - who are old wives? -> metaphor for socio-demographic standing

## Who is in mythological stories?

- gods and heroes
- e.g. Trojan War
    - Odysseus, Agamemnon, Zeus, Poseidon, etc.
- gods and heroes -> what contemporary stories might fit this definition?
    - maybe the Book of Mormon w/ Joseph Smith?

## What happens in mythological stories?

- Cadmus and the Dragon
    - kills dragon, takes its teeth, sows its teeth
    - teeth grow into men
    - throws a rock, men fight each other for it and kill each other
    - 5 men left, become nobility, found city of Thebes with Cadmus
- Eleusinian mysteries (religious cult)
    - Heracles
    - Persephone
        - daughter of Demeter
    - a priest
    - Demeter (goddess of fertile Earth)
        - power of Earth bring forth life, plant life, animal life, human life
    - Triptolemus
    - Hecate (titan goddess of witchcraft, necromancy, ghosts, sorcery)
    - Iambe
    - Dionysus (god of wine and revelry)
- rituals
    - often explained by stories
    - myths help explain things
- time frame for myths?
    - the floating gap
    - sometime in the past
    - purposeful lack of specificity
    - consider:
        - Star Wars -> "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"
            - George Lucas wanted his stories to have a mythological sense to them
        - fairy tales -> "once upon a time"


## Why did Greeks/Romans care about myths?

- relationship between past and present
- founding of things that are commonplace in present
    - Cadmus -> Thebes
    - Demeter goes to Eleusis -> founds Mysteries
- in general mythes want to:
    - justify
    - explain (aetiological)
- key term: **aetiology**
    - causes, reasons, responsibility
    - provides explanation for something
- contemporary myths
    - American revolution (second amendment lovers, resist tyranny)
    - storks brining babies

## Myths, fictions, lies

- are myths true? do people believe their myths? yes and no

### The NO

- no one true version
- compare monotheistic religions
    - book, word of god, orthodox, heretical
    - there can be variations between sects, but each sect thinks their version is absolutely true
- myths contain variations

- e.g., where was Zeus born?
    - some say Crete, some say Arcadia

- why was variation okay? mortals can never have certain knowledge about gods
- compare "revealed religion"

### The YES

- myths worked -> they served their purposes
    - myth of Cadmus worked in giving a civic identity to Thebans

## Why do we care about myths?

- content vs function

- content
    - greek and roman myth are important for understanding references in history, later art and culture
- function
    - compare how greek and roman myth worked with myths that we see in our real lives
    - .e.g., what do these stories accomplish
        - Bill Gates = college dropout
        - the Resistance in Star Wars
        - visual myths in advertising (Marlboro man)

## Provisional definition for myth

- myths are traditional stories embedded within a society that:
    - present or encode the way that a society organizes its way of thinking about the world
- a way of thinking about the world
- perception and experience about the world

# Myth and History

## Overview

- start out as Greek myths
- adopted / adapted by Romans

## Minoan Civilization

- Crete 2700 - 1100 BC
- palace at Knossos
    - sophisticated, centralized socio-political environment, culture
    - relatively large political units with high population
- sea motifs
    - art with dolphins, etc.
- not many walls
    - people assume they are a peaceful people
    - a more likely explanation for no walls = ships
- society was stable enough to produce intricate artwork, paintings
- color convention in paintings
    - men = dark
    - women = light
- prominence of female gods (depicted more often than male gods in Minoan society)
    - maybe they were matriarchal?
- dancers on the seal
    - four women dancing
    - one in the middle seems to be in the air
    - three mortal women worshiping or summoning a goddess
    - likely a depiction of a Minoan religious ritual
    - epiphanic ritual -> for the purpose of making god(s) appear

## Mycenaean Civilization

- mainland Greece
- less advanced than Minoans before making contact
- palace at Pylos
    - how is this different than Knossos
    - had walls
- Mycenaeans seem more warlike than Minoans

### Indo-European language and myth

- Mycenaeans spoke Greek
    - we can read their writing
    - Linear B -> seems to be based on Linear A (from Minoans)
    - linear B has been deciphered
    - now we can say for sure that the Mycenaeans were Greeks
    - wrote mostly records of transactions / contracts
- Minoans.... something else? We can't read their writing (Linear A)
- how do we know that languages are related
    - systematic sound change
    - Grimm's law

### Early Greek in Mycenae

- names of gods are conserved
    - Hera
    - Potnia (seems to be name/title of a Goddess -> in later Greek means mistress)
    - Paian (seems to be the name of a God -> later Greek = one of the names of Apollo)
    - Enyalios (in later Greek becomes Ares)

### Clues in Language

- words that are present give us an idea of cultural background
    - e.g. no word for computer, but words for horse
- we can be pretty sure that proto-indo europeans had a sky god figure
    - zeus pater -> ju-piter -> dyaus pitr = sky father
- theme of undying glory
    - present in sanskrit, and greek
    - inherited from indo-europeans

## End of the Greek Bronze Age

- volcano?
- invaders?
- sea peoples? (Mycenaean refugees)
- destruction of palaces

## Making sense of ruins

- in some sense the Greeks knew even less about Mycenae than we do
- classical mythology provides some way for Greeks to make sense of the ruins that are left behind
    - Theseus and the minotaur
    - interpretation of artifacts from earlier
    - the labyrinth of Crete
    - maybe the story of the labyrinth is an interpretation of the ruins of these Minoan palaces

### Hero worship: the Menelaion of Sparta

- multiple layers built on top of each other
    - every time it was destroyed or torn down
- after dark age, Spartans come across this site
    - they see these remains
    - built a hero shrine on the same hill dedicated to Menelaos and Helen of Sparta

### Signs of worship

- inscriptions dedicated to Menelaos, Helen
    - religious dedication by people (would have cost money)

# Homer: the singer and his tradition

- earliest accounts of what we know as Greek myth
- about 8th century BCE
- seems to carry on memories and traditions from much earlier periods

## The Homeric tradition

- tries to distance past from present
    - "it would take two current humans to do what this hero did"
- what made these survive?
    - written word (after 8th century)
- before 8th century: oral traditions... how do they work?
    - passed down through repeated performances
    - professionals did it (e.g. bards)
- the Odyssey
    - Odysseus was like damn bro that's really good it was like you were there
- why would we want to write these poems down if we have been doing it orally our whole lives?
    - seems quite constrictive (delayed feedback)
    - what's the motivation here?
    - even if we wanted to write it down, what possible use could we have for this?
- for most scholars, there is no single Homer
    - we just attribute an author to a poem
    - the idea of Homer provides that abstraction

## The Homeric poems

- two main ones
- the Iliad and the Odyssey
    - first was about Ilion
    - second was about Odysseus
- how did the Alexandrian scholars judge what was important and what was not in the original works?
    - "city editions" would be stripped down
- these poems were never performed as a whole -> you always pick out the bits you want

## Importance of Homer

- he is central to Greek culture
    - everyone knows Homer
    - education was based on reading Homer
    - later authors assume you know Homer
    - mandated Homeric performances in Athens for example

## Background to the Iliad

- can be quite confusing
    - you are assumed to know the story already
- Homeric world in two parts
    - gods
    - mortals
- gods (immortal, powerful)
    - live in mount Olympus (think of it as heaven, but localized on a mountain)
    - greatest god = Zeus
    - other gods: Hera, Athena, Apollo, Ares, Hermes, Poseidon, Hades, Aphrodite, Demeter, Artemis, etc.
- also minor gods, spirits, etc.
- gods argue, squabble, plot against each other
- concerned with the mortal world
    - presented in a very anthropomorphic and anthropocentric way
    - some of the heroes are children of the gods
- mortals (the ones that matter are "heroes")
    - like us but stronger
    - leaders of different communities
    - often motivated by fame and glory (kleos -> undying glory, your legacy)
    - heroes are depicted as being motivated by the potential for being in a Homeric poem (quite paradoxically)
- the term "Greek" never appears in Homer
    - three interchangeable terms appear instead
    - Achaeans, Danaans, Argives vs Trojans and allies
    - think of Greeks and Trojans as loose groups of communities whose leaders have decided to come together
- leaders
    - Agamemnon is the most powerful king in the story, but he doesn't seem to have any political power over the others
    - Priam is the king of Troy (Ilium), and his son Hector is a commander (but allies also help out)
- background: mortal reasons for war
    - Paris (aka Alexander) takes Helen
    - Menelaus gets his big brother Agamemnon to gather Greeks and get Helen back
- background: gods reason for war
    - lighten the load on the Earth
    - the Earth complains to Zeus and tells him mortals are getting really heavy, can you do something
    - the war is designed to kill off humans
    - but this is speculation / retconning

## The map of ships

- Iliad emphasizes the unity of Greeks as a whole
- united against a common enemy
- panhelenism -> all Greeks have a Greek-ness (united in the purpose of rescuing Helen)

## Story up to the beginning of the Iliad

- Greeks are offended that Helen was taken
- make camp
- besiege the city
    - happens for ten years, can't take it, lots of skirmishing, raiding, looting
- in the tenth year, they take the city and they take prisoners
    - Chryseis was taken -> daughter of the priest of Apollo, Chryses
- Chryses goes to the Greeks to ask for his daughter back
    - they already gave her to Agamemnon, he won't want to give her back
    - but he should give her back because we don't want to upset a priest of Apollo
- Iliad only covers a couple weeks, feels much bigger
    - begins after the war has started, ends before the war ended
- main shape of plot:
    - rage of Achilles (in some sense the Iliad is the story of Achilles)
    - Achilles is offended, stops fighting
    - how does he decide to come back?
    - what are the consequences

## Synopsis

- in book one, the priest shows up and asks for his daughter back
- Agamemnon says no
- priest prays to Apollo to send a plague
- Agamemnon sends daughter back, takes Achilles' prize
- Achilles is angry, decides the other Greeks will pay for this transgression
