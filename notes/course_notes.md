## What happens in mythological stories?

- Cadmus and the Dragon
    - kills dragon, takes its teeth, sows its teeth
    - teeth grow into men
    - throws a rock, men fight each other for it and kill each other
    - 5 men left, become nobility, found city of Thebes with Cadmus
- Eleusinian mysteries (religious cult)

        - Star Wars -> "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"
            - George Lucas wanted his stories to have a mythological sense to them
        - fairy tales -> "once upon a time"


## Why did Greeks/Romans care about myths?

- relationship between past and present
- founding of things that are commonplace in present
    - Cadmus -> Thebes
    - Demeter goes to Eleusis -> founds Mysteries
- in general mythes want to:
    - justify
    - explain (aetiological)
- key term: **aetiology**
    - causes, reasons, responsibility
    - provides explanation for something
- contemporary myths
    - American revolution (second amendment lovers, resist tyranny)
    - storks brining babies

## Myths, fictions, lies

- are myths true? do people believe their myths? yes and no

### The NO

- no one true version
- compare monotheistic religions
    - book, word of god, orthodox, heretical
    - there can be variations between sects, but each sect thinks their version is absolutely true
- myths contain variations

- e.g., where was Zeus born?
    - some say Crete, some say Arcadia

- why was variation okay? mortals can never have certain knowledge about gods
- compare "revealed religion"

### The YES

- myths worked -> they served their purposes
    - myth of Cadmus worked in giving a civic identity to Thebans

## Why do we care about myths?

- content vs function

- content
    - greek and roman myth are important for understanding references in history, later art and culture
- function
    - compare how greek and roman myth worked with myths that we see in our real lives
    - .e.g., what do these stories accomplish
        - Bill Gates = college dropout
        - the Resistance in Star Wars
        - visual myths in advertising (Marlboro man)

## Provisional definition for myth

- myths are traditional stories embedded within a society that:
    - present or encode the way that a society organizes its way of thinking about the world
- a way of thinking about the world
- perception and experience about the world
